# Language in Progress

A language that I don't currently have a name for, however it should focus on these things

* Constructive structural typing
* Integrating dependent types in an imperative language
* Implicit coercion that can be altered by defining proofs for conversion
* An embedding defines a coercion
* Type erasure at runtime
